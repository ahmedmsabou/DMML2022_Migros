# Summary of Project

The goal of this project is to correctly classify the difficulty level of French sentences. For this purpose, we first wanted to know what the baseline performance is. This will help to compare our results and check if a model is working properly.

We found that the most common class among 6 classes has 813 out of 4800 observations, meaning that we have a basline of 0.169375!
